For this exercise I tried using variables for the yellow color, which made the coding easier, since I decided to change the color during my work and it made it easier when I had to use the same color again. 
I also used the function called "if" to make the squares diasappear and appear. My original idea was to make a picture out of different figures and the function "vertex" and then asking the user to press the picture, but the cursor would never be able to touch the picture, and the picture would always be near the cursor, like 2 negative magnets. However, I later discovered that I do not yet posses the knowledge nor skills to do so. I did though find another solution, which is the product you see here. I used to "if" function and the mouseX and mouseY to decide when the square should appear. 

I used the metaphor "Easier said than done" to inspire my work. The task is very simple actually, Press the Square, however it is impossible for the cursor to actually get near either of the 2 squares, so task is simple but at the same time impossible. 

If you play around with the cursor in the window, you will also discover sooner or later, that there is a third square right next to the text. My idea was, that if you pressed this square something would happen like a picture would show up or it would change color. I tried using the "MousePressed" function, but every time I tried it, it did not turn out the way I wanted it, so unfortunately I did not find the time to figure out how to do it this time.

I believe that my work will create some form of frustration, since the squares keep disappearing, but that the hidden square, if found, also can create an element of surprise. 

According to Olga Goriunova, fun can appear in many different forms. I would say that my work contains fun in form of irony, since the goal is so close yet so far away. There is also an element of surprise with the third and hidden square, which could've been enhanced if there had been some sort of feedback if the square would be pressed.
